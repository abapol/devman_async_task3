Microservice for downloading files

The microservice helps the work of the main site made on CMS and serves requests for downloading archives with files. A microservice can do nothing but pack files into an archive.

Creating an archive occurs on the fly upon request from the user. The archive is not saved to disk, instead, as it is packed, it is immediately sent to the user for downloading.

How to install
For the microservice to work, you need Python version no lower than 3.6.

pip install -r requirements.txt
How to start
python server.py
The server will start on port 8080, to check its operation, go to the browser on the page http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
